Content may change frequently as work my way through this article.\n:::\n\nI want to look at...\n\n- The proportion of a person's monthly income that would be dedicated to their monthly mortgage (30-year).\n- The (total cost of a house)/(annual income)\n\nI want to examine this info over time and look at it from a...\n\n- National level\n- State level\n- County level\n\n# nationally \n\nThe data we are using from the [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/):\n\n- *CPIAUCSL*: Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average\n- *MSPUS*: Median Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States\n- *MORTGAGE30US*: 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average in the United States\n- *MEHOINUSA646N*: Median Household Income in the United States\n\n\n\nA first look at the data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](cost-of-housing_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat I need to do:\n\n- Put the data in the same time frequency (use time series models)\n  - CPIAUCSL: monthly\n  - MEHOINUSA646N: annual\n  - MORTGAGE30US: weekly\n  - MSPUS: quarterly\n- Forecast some series to match the most recent data point available.

However, they use the Case-Shiller index which gives the average home price and divide that by the median. This gives a more pessimistic view of the cost of housing than is actual.",

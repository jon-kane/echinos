Dollars are in nominal terms. Hover over the lines to see specific values.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few things that need to be handled before analysis:\n\nThe data is captured at different frequencies.\nThe data begins7 and ends at different dates, with not all the data is recent.\n\n7 The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is the most egregious offender. The reason for this, is that Freddie Mac began surveying lenders on mortgage rates in April 1971, making this the earliest date for which consistent, nationwide data is available.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Latest data points retrieved for each national economic series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseries\ncollection frequency\noldest observation\nnewest observation\n\n\n\n\n30-year fixed mortgage rate\nweekly\nApril 2, 1971\nJanuary 15, 2026\n\n\nconsumer price index\nmonthly\nJanuary 1, 1947\nDecember 1, 2025\n\n\nmedian home price\nquarterly\nJanuary 15, 1953\nApril 1, 2025\n\n\nmedian household income\nannually\nJanuary 1, 1947\nJanuary 1, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo account for (1), I put everything in a monthly frequency. Cubic splines were used for quarterly and annual data, while weekly data was averaged. For (2), I first smoothed each series using LOESS then modeled each series using ARIMA to produce estimates for the most recent date available (January 2026). These estimates should be taken with a grain of salt, though I include \\(3 \\sigma\\) prediction intervals to capture the uncertainty. No retrospective prediction is performed8, so metrics that depend on more than one indicator begin at the earliest date available in all metrics.\n8 There’s too large of a discrepancy between the 30-year fixed mortgage rate and other indicators. Any retrospective predictions that tried to cover that discrepancy would be dominated by uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Harmonized and smoothed economic indicators over time.

I’ll include a linear model to help us understand the trend over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Real median home prices (2026 dollars) over time. Monthly forecasts with 3\\(\\sigma\\) prediction interval. Linear model with 3\\(\\sigma\\) confidence interval. Hover over the lines to see the percentile of the observation and ranges for forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 1953 to January 2026, the real median home price has increased by $3,462 per year on average. This translates to roughly 1.57 pp per year. As of January 2026, the real median home price stands at $417,986, placing it in the 90th percentile of all observations in this period.\nWhat complicates this analysis is that the typical house from the 1950s looks much different than the typical house from today. Across the decades, houses look pretty different, whether that be square footage or amenities. To get a visual sense of these differences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “rambler” (a ranch house) was the most popular style of home for new builds in the 1950s. The home pictured has 3 beds, 1.5 baths, and is 1,234 square feet (excluding the 1-car garage). Images from Town and Country Homes to Fit Your Budget, 1954 p. 60-61.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe modern farmhouse is considered one of the most popular styles of home for new builds in the 2020s. The home pictured has 3 beds, 2.5 baths, and is 1,959 square feet (excluding the 2-car garage). Images from Architectural Designs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Visual comparison of popular homes from the 1950s and 2020s.\n\n\n\nA few key figures on these differences:\n\n\n\nTable 3: Comparison of housing features from 1950s to 2020s\n\n\n\n\n\nfeature\n1950’s home\n2020’s home\n\n\n\n\nmedian size\nunder 1,000 sq ft\nover 2,000 sq ft\n\n\ncomplete plumbing\n66%\n99%\n\n\nair conditioning\nunder 2%\nover 90%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Latham did a great analysis on housing affordability where he found that the price per square foot of a house (ignoring amenities) from 1978-2023 grew by 20% which works out to roughly 0.44 pp per year which is about 28% the rate of house prices in general.\nOf course the problem in all this is you can’t buy a 1950’s new-build today; the option for a smaller, less feature rich house just isn’t available today as it was in the past. Those aren’t the houses being built, so buyers are left with nicer, larger9, and more expensive houses.\n9 Ironically, households have been shrinking over the same time that houses have gotten larger. However, the median square footage of new builds has been decreasing over the last decade.Fortunately, we are coming out of a bubble which peaked in early 2022, so prices are cheaper today than a few years ago. However, unless housing policy/supply changes, we should expect housing to get more expensive.\n\n\nreal household income\nLet’s put the nominal median household income in 2026 dollars. I’ll include a linear model to help us understand the trend over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: real median household income (2026 dollars) over time. Monthly forecasts with 3\\(\\sigma\\) prediction interval. Linear model with 3\\(\\sigma\\) confidence interval. Hover over the lines to see the percentile of the observation and ranges for forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 1947 to January 2026, the real median household income has increased by $398 per year on average. As of January 2026, the real median household income stands at $92,742, placing it in the 100th percentile of all observations in this period.\nThere are three periods worth focusing on in Figure 5: Mid 1948 - late 1964, late 1964 - early 2012, and early 2012 - today. These periods are marked by significant growth (4.3 pp/year), little to no growth (0.02 pp/year), and substantial growth (1.88 pp/year), respectively. Let’s examine each of these periods in turn.\n\nMid 1948 - late 1964\nThis period saw significant growth over a brief period of time. From June 1948 to December 1964, real median household income grew from $42,496 to $72,636 representing an annual growth of 4.3 pp per year. Post WWII, with Europe and Japan having to rebuild their industrial bases and with the establishment of the Bretton Woods System, the US was poised to become an economic powerhouse, facing almost no industrial competition. By the early 1950s, the US produced nearly half (44.8%) of the world’s manufactured goods (Bairoch 1982, 275). Technological advancements were largely responsible for significant increases to productivity (Kendrick 1961) with much of the productivity gains benefiting the typical worker.\n\n\nLate 1964 - early 2012\nThis period saw little to no growth. From December 1964 to January 2012, the real median household income only grew to $73,436 representing an annual growth of 0.02 pp per year. Of course there were highs and lows over this period10, but overall growth was stagnant. Further analyzing this period becomes nebulous quickly. Analysis by Stephen Rose at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning think tank, have found that when you include all payments (e.g. benefits from employer), from 1979 - 2013 real income grew by roughly 1.1 pp per year. Furthermore, when you break up the analysis by different demographics (age, gender, education, etc.) you see some groups had significant growth while others lagged behind (Rose 2015)11.\n10 The peak income over this period was reached on July 1999 at $81,120 representing a growth of 0.34 pp per year. The lowest income over this period was reached on June 1982 at $69,180 representing a decline of -0.14 pp per year.11 Groups that saw significant growth: Ages 60+, women, and education level of BA or higher. Groups that lagged in growth: Ages 25-34, men, and education levels below BA.\n\nEarly 2012 - today\nThis period has seen substantial growth. From January 2012 to January 2026, the real median household income grew to $92,742 representing an annual growth of 1.88 pp per year. Post the great recession and pre-covid, the unemployment rate declined to its lowest level in 50 years (Gould 2020); a shrinking labor supply relative to demand forced employers to raise wages to attract and retain staff, helping to drive up wages. Post-covid, a similar story occurred, except the lowest-paid workers (10th percentile) saw the most real wage growth12, driven by young, non-college workers disproportionately moving away from the hospitality sector into higher-paying jobs (Autor, Dube, and McGrew 2023). This compression at the bottom pushed the overall median household income up.\n12 This was measured over January 2020 to June 2023. Over this same period, higher-income workers (90th percentile) saw a decline in real wages\n\n\nprice-to-income ratio\nWith the context from the previous two metrics, I’ll examine the two most critical metrics: the price-to-income ratio and the debt-to-income ratio. I’ll examine the former first.\nThe price-to-income is calculated simply as,\n\\[\\frac{\\text{median sales price of a house}}{\\text{median household income}}\\]\nThis ratio tells us the sales price of a house as a multiple of the typical household income. We can use nominal dollars to calculate the price-to-income ratio. As before, I’ll include a linear model to help us understand the trend over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Ratio of median home price to median household income over time. Monthly forecasts with 3\\(\\sigma\\) prediction interval. Linear model with 3\\(\\sigma\\) confidence interval. Hover over the lines to see the percentile of the observation and ranges for forecasts.\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 1953 to January 2026, the price-to-income ratio of a home has increased by 2.85 pp per year on average. As of January 2026, the ratio stands at 4.51, placing it in the 73rd percentile of all observations in this period.\nFOCUS ANALYSIS ON TWO PERIODS: 1953-1963 AND POST 1963. NEED TO INCLUDE RECESSION BARS IN ALL FIGURES.\nFrom 1953 to late 1963, the price-to-income ratio fell precipitously13, from a peak of 4.58 on January 1953 to a trough of 2.67 on October 1963 representing an annual decline of 3.87 pp per year. The decline of price-to-income in this period was driven by strong growth in real household income and slight decline in the real median home price.\n13 This is probably overstated a bit since due to quality of data from pre-1963. See Table 1 for details.\n\ndebt-to-income ratio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Ratio of monthly mortgage to monthly income over time. Monthly forecasts with 3\\(\\sigma\\) prediction interval.

As of January 2026, the ratio stands at 0.26, placing it in the 46th percentile of all observations in this period."

I have a noisy brain. I'm also forgetful. In an attempt to organize that noise, and to help me remember things, I've started this website to share things that I find interesting. 

Most musings will probably have a data science flavor, though I make no promises. This website is powered by coffee, so if you find any of this helpful and would like to support my work, consider buying me a coffee.

The animation on this page is of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">collatz conjecture</a> and was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture#/media/File:Collatz_conjecture_tree_visualization.png">this visual</a>.
